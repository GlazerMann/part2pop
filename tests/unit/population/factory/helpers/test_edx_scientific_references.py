"""Stoichiometric characterization of the EDX elemental-to-species reconstruction.

Reference inputs are calculated independently from pure-compound formulas,
normalizing the masses of EDX-measurable elements (hydrogen is omitted).
These are *synthetic stoichiometric reference cases*, not laboratory EDX data.

Passing the tests demonstrates existing reconstruction behavior, NOT chemical
speciation accuracy. EDX does not uniquely identify chemical compounds.

Known scientific limitations of the current default reconstruction:
  * Zn is allocated to OIN without allocating its oxide oxygen; ZnO oxygen
    therefore appears in the reconstructed OC bin.
  * Carbon in inorganic carbonate (e.g., CaCO3), and part of its oxygen,
    are allocated to OC rather than to an inorganic carbonate.
  * Nitrogen in ammonium sulfate is allocated to OC; sulfate and ammonium
    cannot be represented as distinct compounds by the present scheme.
  * Particle class affects the sulfate/organic allocation, and EDX alone
    cannot establish whether a particle is biological or carbonaceous.

Path forward (separate scientific change; NOT part of refactor PR #108):
  1. Define and document alternative, selectable reconstruction schemes
     for oxides (including ZnO), carbonates, and ammonium-bearing salts.
  2. Track oxygen/elemental mass balance and chemical ambiguity explicitly;
     retain the legacy behavior for reproducibility and update these
     characterization expectations only when selecting a new scheme.
  3. Validate those schemes against measured reference aerosols with known
     composition, blank/substrate corrections, and independent chemical
     speciation (for example, sulfate/ammonium via ion chromatography).
